I'm trying to solve these problems on http://projecteuler.net/

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

Try to solve ONE problem per day.Use Python/ObjC.

I put my finished tasks in the overComed folder, 
and in each folder such as p001,
    p001.py is the answer find by myself,
    s001.py is the answer based on the cheat sheet:)
